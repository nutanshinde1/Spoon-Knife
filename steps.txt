forking a repository on GitHub:


1. Locate the repository
Go to the GitHub repository you want to fork.

2. Click “Fork”
In the top-right corner, click the **Fork** button.
GitHub will create a copy of the repository under your own account.

3. Clone your fork locally
On your forked repository page, click **Code** → copy the HTTPS/SSH link → run in your terminal or GitHub Desktop:


git clone <repository-link>


4. Create a new branch
Switch to a new branch to make your changes:


git checkout -b <branch-name>


5. Make changes

Edit, add, or delete files as needed.

6. Commit and push
Commit your changes locally and push them to your fork:


git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push origin <branch-name>


7. Create a Pull Request
Go to your fork on GitHub → you’ll see a **Compare & pull request** button → click it.
Fill in the title and description, then submit the pull request to the original repository.


If you want, I can now explain **how this fork connects with pull requests** so that your PR count increases.
